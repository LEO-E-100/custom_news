    "# Custom News Project Details\n",

    "The overall aim of this project was\n",
    "\n",
    "> To produce an app that would learn from prior reading habits of users and return a customised news feed based on that\n",
    "\n",
    "This was achieved in a process of gathering a supervised learning dataset, applying a classifier to it and then applying this classifier to a set of regularly updated articles and sending the results of this classification to the end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) API to get a list of articles with pre assigned tags of `y` or `n` for if the user found it interesting or not. The API is used to turn the links into a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the [Embed.rocks](https://embed.rocks/) API to gather the raw HTML from the URLs provided and `BeautifulSoup`. This creates a dataframe with four columns, `URL`, `Wanted`, `HTML` and `text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vectorize and Classify the text in this `text` column. This trains a model to predict whether future articles will fall into the 'interested' or 'not interested' category.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use IFTTT to pass articles from RSS feeds into a Google Sheet. Use the `gspread` library to pass data from Google Sheet to a pandas dataframe. Run the pickled model on this dataframe to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use IFTTT to send an email with 5 chosen articles linked on. At the same time a flask app will do the same and reveal the 5 chosen articles."
